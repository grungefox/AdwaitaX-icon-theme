# AdwaitaX icon theme
### Additional set of icons for Gnome's default theme - Adwaita.

AdwaitaX (as AdwaitaX-panded, or AdwaitaX-tended) is additional set of icons to match many third-party (including proprietary) apps logos with Adwaita design made by GNOME Project, while making them as close to original as possibile.  
**<sub><sup>Unfortunately for now in many cases it doesn't respects GNOME Human Interface Guidelines colours, and tries to use colour pallet of original icon, but there is a future plan of adding special HIG version</sup></sub>**
